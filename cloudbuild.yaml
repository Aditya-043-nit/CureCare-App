# cloudbuild.yaml
# This file explicitly tells Google Cloud Build how to deploy your App Engine app.

steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
# The 'gcloud app deploy' command will read your app.yaml,
# install dependencies from requirements.txt, and deploy your app.
# It takes care of finding the Python runtime specified in app.yaml.
args: ['app', 'deploy', '--project', '${PROJECT_ID}', '--quiet']
# '--project', '${PROJECT_ID}' ensures it deploys to the correct project.
# '${PROJECT_ID}' is an automatic variable provided by Cloud Build.
# '--quiet' prevents interactive prompts during deployment.

# Optional: You can add more steps here if needed, e.g., running tests,
# building static assets, etc. However, for a standard Flask app deployment
# to App Engine, the 'gcloud app deploy' command is usually sufficient.
